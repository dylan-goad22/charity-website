      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        The Teach A Man To Fish Foundation is a non-profit organization that
        commits time and funds to creating better lives for the less fortunate
        in our society. Despite our name, we help everyone without
        discrimination. Hardships target everyone, and we want to help everyone
        overcome them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our teams travel across America and find those who are homeless, get
        them cleaned up and well fed, and then start a process. Our headquarters
        in Dallas, Texas serves as a staging grounds for helping those
        individuals. If they agree to our proposal, the selected individuals
        will be housed and trained in several different fields of their
        choosing. Once they complete the program, we help them settle in the
        career world to start their renewed life!

    <h2>Who We've Helped</h2>

    <div class="help">
      <h3>Jeffrey</h3>

        class="help1"
      />
      <p>
        This is Jeffrey. He was found in Dallas, Texas begging the local
        businessmen for spare change. When we approached him with the
        opportunity to become successful, he was ecstatic. He followed through
        with the program and now Jeffrey no longer begs those businessmen
        because he became one himself.

    <div class="help">
      <h3>Martin</h3>

        class="help2"
      />
      <p>
        Martin was nominated by his concerned family. Our team picked him up in
        Fort Worth, Texas and immediately gave him help. He was transported back
        to Dallas temporarily and he began training to have his dream job, a
        business owner. He opened up a barber shop and now assists TAMTF
        Foundation with cleaning up more individuals that are brought into our
        program.
